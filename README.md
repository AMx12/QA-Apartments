**Project: QA Apartments**

**Summary**

_The product is a web app aimed to replace QA Academy&#39;s current solution to managing apartment information and trainee apartment allocations. The product, a Java EE application, needs to contain this information in a database and allow the user to interact with this data via a web-based front end. Maven has been used to support the building of this product and the contained dependencies._
